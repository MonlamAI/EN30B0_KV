The Chariot of the Vidyādharas: An Aspiration Prayer for Traveling to the Realm of Lotus Light OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HŪṂ The wisdom of the great, indestructible sphere Shines in the limpid sky of innate clear light, And the unity of space and wisdom, like a rainbow, appears for all to see As the supreme, naturally emanated realm of Lotus Light. In an expanse of rings of rainbow light, the direct realization of dharmatā, Arises the great mansion, the increasing of experience, Where throngs of ḍākas and ḍākinīs, with awareness reaching fullness, Enact vajra dances and song, the exhaustion of phenomena beyond the mind. In its center preside the primordial lord Amitābha, The great treasure of compassion, Padmapāṇi, And the one who realizes the three kāyas, the immortal Tötreng Tsal, With his eight principal emanations and others, all manifesting to tame beings each in their own way. Here, in this gathering place of the great magical net Of your infinite display of aspects and forms, May I and others, the ocean of sentient beings pervading space, All be reborn the instant we depart this life. Once there, taking the special path of the four vidyādhara stages, May we swiftly attain the level of the Lake-Born Guru Who embodies oceans of kāyas and wisdom, And spontaneously accomplish the benefit of ourselves and others! These were the words of the divine Jamyang Khyentse, a holy one among the vidyādharas, being whatever instantly arose on the tenth day of the month of miracles. Siddhirastu!
